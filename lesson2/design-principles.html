                        Spotify's website exemplifies proximity because the page groups together related content to create a clear visual hierarchy that guides the user's attention towards the premium subscription package. When a user enters the page, the first thing they see is a discount for the subscription, which is prominently displayed in the center of the page. Beneath that, the benefits of the premium subscription are listed in a clear and concise manner. This proximity of related content helps to create a cohesive message that emphasizes the value of the premium subscription package. Finally, the various subscription plans are presented in a grid format, which further reinforces the visual alignment of the page and guides the user towards making a purchase. Overall, the use of proximity in Spotify's website design helps to create a clear and effective emphasis on the premium subscription package.

                        Family Search website we can see the web design principle of repetition. This principle is manifested in this website in every different section/ topic of the page as we can notice that first comes the big font size phrases, then the smaller text and then a button to redirect the user to that specific topic or section.

                    <h3>Contrast</h3>
                        <a href="https://www.byui.edu/">Brigham Young University - Idaho</a>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Brigham Young University - Idaho is a wonderful example of the principle of contrast. Contrast, in web design means to highlight important details in the website in order to get the attention of the user. It could be through size, color, or content. In this specific website we can see that the first image is much larger than all of the other ones and that the words on the image have different font sizes to contrast and get the user's attention and to highlight the main message and first impression that they want the user to get from the website.
